twitter_timeline_and_search - https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/twitter/README.md

Step 1 - 

	use cases:

		- user posts a tweet
			- service pushes tweet to followers, send push notifications and emails
		- user views the home timeline (activities from the people the user is following)
		- user views the user timeline (activity from the user)
		- user searches keywords

	out of scope:

		- twitter streaming / firehose
		- stripping tweets due to user visibility settings:
			- hide @reply if user is not following the person being replied to
		- ananlytics

	constraints:

		General:

			- posting a tweet should be fast:
				- fanning out a tweet to all of your followers should be fast, 
					unless you have millions of followers
			- 100 million active users
			- 500 million tweets per day or 15 billion tweets per month:
				- each tweet averages a fanout of 10 deliveres
				- 5 billion tweets delivered on fanout per day
				- 150 billion tweets delivered on fanout per month
			- ~8 billion reads per day 
			- 250 billion read requests per month
			- ~ 0.3 billion search requests per day 
			- 10 billion searches per month

		Timeline:

			- viewing the timeline should be fast
			- twitter is more read heavy than wwrite heavy
				- optimize for fast reads of tweets
			- ingesting tweets is write heavy

		Search:

			- search should be fast
			- search is read-heavy

	usage:

		- size pre tweet:
			- tweet_id - 8 bytes
			- user_id - 32 bytes
			- text - 140 bytes
			- media 10 kb average
			Total - ~10 kb
		- 150 tb of new tweets per month:
			- 10 kb * 500 million tweets per day * 30 days
			- 5.4 pb of new tweets every 3 years
		- 6000 tweets per second
		- 60000 delivered tweets per second  
		- 100000 read requests per second
		- 4000 search requests per second
